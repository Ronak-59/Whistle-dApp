    This is a mock of the NuCypher network for Hackathons.

    Note: The actual network is not ready yet and is in current active development.
        Hackers should use this as a means to play with and simulate the real network.

    BASIC OVERVIEW:
        Call `grant` with a list of kfrags from Umbral to grant a policy on the mock
        network. This will return a policy id that you will use to access the mock network.

        Call `reencrypt` to perform a complete mocked re-encryption on the NuCypher network.
        This does not require that you search for nodes on the network, this works only if you know
        the minimum number of re-encryptions (`M`).

        Call `revoke` to revoke a policy on the mock NuCypher network. This works by simply
        deleting the kfrags off the mocked network.
